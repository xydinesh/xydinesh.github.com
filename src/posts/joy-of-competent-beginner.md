I enjoy learning new things for short periods of time. Usually only for one to two months. I love the journey where I start from without knowing anything to a competent skill level. I called this stage "competent beginner". In the competent beginner stage, I'm still a beginner but I have knowledge to make informed decisions on safety, equipment, and skills of that activity.

The joy of the competent beginner stage is that I can go from not knowing anything to competent beginner with minimum effort. If I take lessons every day I can reach competent beginner stage with in a week. For example, in snow-boarding it took me three full days, in wind-surfing took me three days lessons to reach competent beginner level. Of course, with more time I can acquire more skills and still be a competent beginner. I was highlighting the minimum time I needed.

I have given myself permission to abandon progress after reaching competent beginner stage. I have abandoned progress in many activities, not because I don't like them. I reached a level where I can do what I want comfortably. If I want to progress beyond that point I have to invest more time and effort. For example, windsurfing, snowboarding, long distance running, golf, woodwork, photography, and leather crafting are some of the activities I have abandon progress after reaching competent beginner level.

Also, there are activities I have pursued multiple years, because those are aligned with my values. The best example is weight lifting, I started weightlifting in CrossFit classes I attended while ago. I realized weightlifting is something I enjoy and aligns with my values (being healthy).

I enjoy exploring new things. The best way to explore new activity is acquiring minimum skills need in the shortest time. That way I can enjoy the activity and the journey in becoming a competent beginner. In addition, In the process of discovering new things, I have to abandon something to make room and time for new things.

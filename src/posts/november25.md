November, 2025

I maintained the now page in my blog and decided to change the format and make it a regular post, with "now" tag. Since these now posts are in frequent I can use the month as title of the page.

## Yakada Labs
This month I quit my job in Salesforce after 8 years to start my own business. I plan to work on AI space creating custom solutions for customers. Check out [Yakada Labs](https://yakadalabs.com), I want to get a few customers onboarded before looking into fundraising.

## Fastbreak
This month through Yakada Labs, I started working with FastBreak AI. I'm working on setting up their infrastructure. I'm back to programming and setting up AWS infrastructure. The group I'm working with mostly from the previous startup MapAnything.

## Traveling
During thanksgiving week in the US, I traveled to Bogota, Colombia. Before, I arrived in Colombia I was afraid because of the stories I read online. However, after I arrived, I felt very safe. I did some hiking in Chicaque Natural Park, close to Bogota and Explored the city for a bit.

## Reading
While I'm on vacation I read following books
 1. Deep Work by Cal Newport
 2. Useful not True by Derek Sivers
 3. Founding Sales by Peter Kazanjy

All three books are invaluable for making progress in my new company. I'm glad I read them during my vacation, I have new energy to dive into work week next week.

## Food

The best thing about Bogota was food. There were so many soups with different flavors.
 1. Changua - Milk Soup, Tried for breakfast. It was made with milk and eggs. Served with bread and cheese.
 2. Cazuelitas 93 - Found this restaurant from Gemini recommendation. It was my favorite restaurant in Bogota. Only opened for Lunch though
    - Cazuelita del Arrier
    - Cazuelita de Mondongo
    - Cazuelita de Lentejas del Rancho
    Three different soups, I tried three different days. Cazuelita's de Lentejas probably my favorite. They served soup with fried pork pieces, rice, fried plantain and half of avocado. It cost about 50 Colombian pesos, including fresh juice.
 3. Cuatro Cocina Casual - I stayed in Hotel B3, this is hotel restaurant. Breakfast was included and they service breakfast in buffet.
    - Arroz cremoso de mariscos, I tried this for dinner one day. This was my favorite rice dish with seafood.

I loved the different soup options and variety in fresh juices.

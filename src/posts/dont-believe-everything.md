This book highlights the importance of mindfulness and dangers of distracted mind. Author lays out practical advises for establishing mindful (non-thinking) state. Here are some of the notes from the book,

- Read this book for not for information but for insight
- In other words, pain is unavoidable but how we react to that pain is up to us. That reaction will dictate if we suffer or not
- Root cause of our suffering is our own thinking.
- Thoughts
	- What naturally comes up in our mind
	- Thoughts are something we have
- Thinking
	- Our reaction and judgment about our thoughts
	- Usually, thinking creates burden, anxiety, and stress in our mind
	- Thinking is something we do, that is engage in thoughts
- If we change our thinking about an event, as a result we can change the expirence and emotional reaction to the event
- Thoughts creates and thinking destroys. Thinking limits, criticize and judge the thoughts.
- We don’t need thinking or thoughts to feel positive emotions. Inherently we have positive emotions and we have to be in the moment to feel them
- It is not what we are thinking about cause the suffering, the fact that we are thinking causes the suffering
- We need to practice and use non-thinking techniques through out the day to avoid thinking
	- It could be meditation, PAUSE method or any other technique. Important thing is that we have to carry out through out the day
- When we live a life of non-thinking, we create goals and ambitions out of inspiration not desperation
- When we have goals out of inspiration, we make progress on those goals everyday. It doesn’t matter how long you are doing it, what matters is that you are doing it in some capacity every day.
- Our job is determining what we want, not how to get it. When we figure out what we want, universe will get us there

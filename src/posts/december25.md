December, 2025

Not much happened this month outside of the regular routine. The kids are home from December 19 to January 7th for the holiday break.

## Yakada Labs

As for work, I'm enjoying getting back to development. However, I miss having a team and regular 1:1s. The regular 1:1s and check in on my team were the highlights of my day as a manager. Working from home, I feel a lack of connection.

## Bachata

In mid December, I finished 8 weeks Bachata dancing class with [Adventures in dancing](https://www.adventuresindance.com/). I had a lot of fun over the 8 weeks. Starting in January, I'm going to take Tango lessons with the same school.

## Workout

This month, I started doing 5 push-ups, 5 pull-ups and 5 ring dips every hour during the day. My goal is to hit 50 push-ups, 50 pull-ups and 50 ring dips every day. If I keep up with this pace, I will be able to hit 1000 push-ups, 1000 pull-ups and 1000 ring dips during month of December. I'm doing this in addition to my regular workout.

## Reading
I've had a good momentum going with my reading since last month. I came across a few great books this month.

1. "Courage to be disliked" by  Ichiro Kishimi, Fumitake Koga

This book gave me several new insights into how to live and how to manage interpersonal relationship. It's probably one of the best I've read.

2. "Don't believe everything you think" by Joseph Nguyen

A small book, the main premise of the book is to encourage you to stay mindful all the time. The book refers to this time as time of non-thinking; for me, it the time when you are mindful.

3. "Models: Attract women through honesty" by Mark Manson

I'm still reading this, and I like the framework the author is suggesting. Rejection is not a failure; that's how we filter through incompatible partners.

4. "Hoot" by Carl Hiaasen

This is a middle school fiction, that takes place in Florida. I haven't read much fiction, but I enjoyed this book.

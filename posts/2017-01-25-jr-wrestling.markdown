# Junior Wrestling

Last Sunday was a rough day for both me and my son (Ahas). Ahas ended up loosing all wrestling matches in the tournament. I have clearly set both of our expectation not for the wins but for doing his 
best. I was disappointed because I felt like Ahas was not doing his best. After the tournament I asked him why didn’t he gave his best. That made him so upset. He repeatedly told me that he gave his 
best. That night I had time to reflect. I came up with better ideas for dealing with his losses.

1. I should not be the judge of whether Ahas gave his best or not. I can question him to ask if he gave his best and should be ready accept his answer.

1. I should be appreciative of his effort to get out there and wrestle.

1. We (Both me and Ahas) need to come up with `SMART` goals for him to achieve during tournaments.


S - Specific<br/>
M - Measurable<br/>
A - Agreed Upon<br/>
R - Realistic<br/>
T - Time based<br/>


  For example:


1. Not let opponent pin him.
2. Try to score 3 points.
3. Try to stay 1 min before ending this game.


I'm going to give these ideas a try for coming tournament.

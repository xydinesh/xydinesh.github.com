# Docker in docker

Often we want to test CI tasks in local environment. Docker in docker (dind) is helpful for running CI tasks locally. We use two images, `docker:dind` and `docker`, and a docker network to communicate between two instances.

```
docker network create gitlab
docker run --name docker --privileged --network gitlab -d docker:dind
docker run --network gitlab -v $PWD:/opt/base -ti docker /bin/sh
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2375
```

After these steps, we have current directory mapped in `/opt/base` where we can run `docker build` to test images or CI tasks.
```
docker info
cd /opt/base
docker build -t xydinesh/base .
```

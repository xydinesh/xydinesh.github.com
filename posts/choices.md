# Choices & Goals

The success of our goals depends on the choices we make. When we have a long term goal we have to make choices daily that can help us achieve our long term goal.
If we are doing things that is not moving us toward our long term goal or moving us away from the goal, that is an indication that goal is not aligned with our values. It is a sign that we will not be able to acheive that goal. When we figure out that we are not moving towards our long term goal, it is a good time to pivot. We can find a goal that aligns with your values, one we can make progress every day.
